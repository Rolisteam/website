# Load Token on Vectorial Map

Loading `rtok` file into vectorial map is very easy. Just drag and drop the rtok file from your system file browser to the vectorial.
`rtok` does not work on old rolisteam maps.

# Change Health value

When the rtok is loaded, it appears on the vectorial map and it is listed inside the player/character list as a character of the localplayer (the player who add them).

# Use initiative

**Initiative** can be rolled from the vectorial map contextual menu.
When character has initiative score it appears on the left-top corner of the token.
It is possible to unset the score (e.g at the end of the fight), or to hide them (`menu > view > map > show/hide initiative`)
