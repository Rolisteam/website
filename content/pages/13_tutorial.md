# Rolisteam

![images]({filename}/images/logo_rolisteam.png)

**Rolisteam** is a **free virtual table software**. Pen and paper Role playing games are traditionnaly made around table. Virtual table software seems to be the right solution to overcome real life difficulties.

It is also multiplatform software (Windows, MacOS and Linux). Download it here : [http://www.rolisteam.org/download](http://www.rolisteam.org/download) 
then install it on your computer. **Rolisteam** provides many features to live a better game experience (such as : maps, images, dice roller, charactersheet, background music). 

**Rolisteam** is available in several languages: english, french, spanish, german, portuguese, hungrian, dutch, romanian and partially in turkish.

Now, Let's explain how to use **Rolisteam**. Many screenshots illustrate this tutorial to make it funnier and easier to understand.

#I – Start and Settings

On start, Rolisteam appears and above it there is the *connection panel*. This panel allows you to add and set connection profile. You must set correct values to ensure the connection establishement. 
"Player" profile requires definition of player's character as well. 
This panel may store several connection profile.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/04_connexion_mj_en.jpg)

Change the default profile or create another one. We recommand to set a meaningful name. It makes it easier.  
For example, I use to play as GM on Wednesday and as player on Monday, names of my profiles are: Game on Monday, Game on Wednesday.

There are four connection mode in **Rolisteam**: 

* Host and GM
* Client and GM
* Host and Player
* Client and Player

**GMs** (Game Masters) have more control and power over **Rolisteam** than **players**. They can add maps or images. They control background music and many more stuff.

The differences between **host** and **client** may appear not really obvious. Hosting the game means that all game players must connect to you.
If the hosting **Rolisteam** is closed, everybody will be disconnected from the game.

## Game Master or Player

The *Player* area is dedicated to describe yourself. You have to pick up (nick)name (it will appears to other players) and select a color. For a better game experience, it is better than all players chose a very different color.

The last thing is a checkbox "**I am the game master**". Check it only if you are the GM, obviously. 

If you are a player, the connection panel allows you to describe your character thinks of the "**Character**" zone.
It is displayed only when you are not the **game master**. 

You must set the character name, color and avatar. It is recommanded to use square image as avatar (for better good looking on vectorial maps).

## Host or Client

### Host
If you host the game, the server must be on your side. You don't need to set an address. You must pick up a port and check "**Host the game**".
When you are confident about your connection profile, you must click on "**Connect**". If everything goes right, the connection profile dialog disappears and let you access to the main application window.

In the notification area (Top right corner), there is a reminder of connection information you should give to other game participants. 

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/14_notification_zone_en.jpg)

As you can see, the address in our case is *194.250.98.228*, and the port is *6661*. By default, **Rolisteam** use the port *6660*. You can change it as you want but please avoid port number used by another service.  

Chose the host carefully, bandwidth and stability are the main two criteria.   
Game experience will be better. DSL line is enough and do the job perfectly. Keep in mind, the host must stay until the end of game. Everyone will be disconnected if the host is off. 

### Client
If you connect as client, you need an address and port number to join the game. Rolisteam can access IP address  (example: *194.250.98.228*), or domain namee (rolisteam.org, games.foo.com). The host must give you those information.

Uncheck the "host the game" checkbox. 

Then you are all set. Click on **Connection**. If it goes right, the connection dialog disappears and you have acces to the application.

# First Start

When the connection is set, you must see something like this.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/05_global_en.jpg)

Lets pay a visit to all panels to see which informations you can find in which panels.

On sides of the application, there are dockwidgets. You can move those dockwidgets, let them floating or group them. So you can group them to see important ones all the time. Others can be seen when you want/need by clicking on their tab.
Of course, those dockwidget can be closed (the cross on the top right corner). You can hide/show dockwidget thanks of the **subwindow** menu.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/09_menu_fenetre_en.jpg)

## Check Connection Status

To know at any time you connection status, just look at the title bar of **rolisteam**.  
There are in that order: current story name, software version, Connection status «**connected**» or «**disconnected**», connection type ( **client** or **server**) and the application's name **Rolisteam**.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/30_window_title_en.jpg)

## Notification Area

As you have seen, the notification area is useful when hosting the game. It gives you all information you need to send to other players.  
This panel have more features than that. 
All events on the network are logged inside it. 
So you can see new incoming connection or player's disconnection. 
It provides progressbar for long (receiving) transfert.   

## Instant messaging

This area lists all instant messaging windows. By default, **Rolisteam** sets global messaging (to everyone) and point-to-point connection to each other players.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/02_ChatList_en.jpg)

You can create chat window and set it with all/one/many/no players. You can talk about your next tactic. 

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/15_nouveauChat_en.jpg)


## Players list

This panel displays all connected players and theirs characters. You can expand or collapse the character lists for each player. Character's avatars can been seen here.   
This panel is very important when you are using maps in **Rolisteam**. We talk about it below in this document.
 
![images]({filename}/images/tuto/18_playerlist_en.jpg)


## Audio Players 


**Rolisteam** has three audio players to manage three tracks at the same time.  
You may hide them if you need fewer audio players or more space.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/24_music_player_en.jpg) 

All commands are available through contecxtual menu (right-click).   
You may load playlist, audio files or links to stream and remote files.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/27_music_contextual_menu_en.jpg)


## Resources Manager

The resources manager keeps track of all files you have opened in rolisteam. It provides a way to re-open them really quickly. 
You may sort files into folders. 


![images]({filename}/images/tuto/23_resources_browser_en.jpg) 

# Play with Rolisteam

Now, you know each panel of **rolisteam**. We will focus on features and how to use them.

## Instant messaging

To open chat messaging, nothing simpler, you have to check chat you want. It is useful to open «**global**». You can discuss with all other players. 
You can discuss only with one other players.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/02_ChatList_en.jpg) 

If chat name are blinking from green to red, it means you received message.

You may add new chat with whoever or when you want.

##  Add new chat 

On the bottom, there is a button to *add new chat*.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/15_nouveauChat_en.jpg)

Chat has name, owner and participating player lists.
The owner is automatically set. You can chose all the other parameters.

Just click on "Ok" to validate.

### What can we do in chatwindow ? 

The main feature is obviously to send messages to other players.
You can be identified as yourself or as your character.
It is usefull to split in game talking and ooc talkings.  

**Rolisteam** convert all http address to clickable link.  

You can describe your character action with the command **/me** followed by the action description.  
_Exemple_:  
**/me** draws her sword and adopts a defensive stance!

It appears like this:

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/25_tchat_commun_en.jpg)

You can easily resend messages thanks to message history. Just press ```up``` and ```bottom``` to navigate inside the history and then press ```Enter``` to resend the selected message.

### Contextual menu reachable features 

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/08_menu_chat_en.jpg)

Chat windows have 3 contextual menu reachable features:

* You can change the background color of chat window. 
* Chat windows can be put out of **Rolisteam**. It provides a better control of the workspace. 
* You can display timestamp on message reception. 

## Roll some dice

Chat window is also where you can roll dice by sending commands. 
**Rolisteam** embeds a powerful engine based on generic operator.  
Those operators can be combined to make computation in repect with game mechanism to give you final answer easy to read.
To roll one die with 6 slides, the command is: **!1d6**

The exclamation mark is important, It marks the beginning of dice command but it can be replaced by some other characters.  
**&** marks a secret command. Only you can see the result.  
**#** send command to the GM (and only him/her).

* &2d6
* #2d6

**Rolisteam** can roll any kinds of dice.

* Roll die between 0 and 9 : !1d[0-9]
* Roll 20 dice with 100 slides : !20d100
* Roll die and add 4 to the die result : !1d20+4
* Roll four dice and the result defines how many dice with 10 slides it will roll: !(4d6)d10
* Roll 6 dice with 10 slides, they explode on 10 and we keep the 3 best dice: !6d10e10k3
* Math expression: !5-5\*5+5


The result is always displayed in red for better readbility. 

**Rolisteam** deals with many operators,  you can find complete list on this [web page](http://wiki.rolisteam.org/index.php/En:Dice). There are examples as well.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/31_dice_result_en.jpg)

To share/find game specific command, please go to [Rolisteam forum](http://forum.rolisteam.org).

### Dice Alias (or how to make your life easier)

Complex system may require complex and long command. The alias system is dedicated to help in this case. It provides a way to simplify commands. 

Let see this example: !6d10e10k3  
This command implements the Roll & Keep system from «Legend of the 5 rings».
It is painful to write the command every time. A shorter command will be appreciated and more pratical.
To do so, **Rolisteam** provides aliases. To write a clever alias, you have to think about few points.
First, identify the changing part of the system.  
Does the dice number change ?  
Does the difficulty threshold change ?  
etc.  

Those are the questions you should ask yourself.   
In our case, the rolled dice and kept dice change.
So, you can define an alias in the preferences dialogs.

Alias: K => d10e10k  
how to use it:   

* !6K3 = !6d10e10k3  
* !8K4 = !8d10e10k4  

There are two kinds of alias:
Alias by replace (like the previous example)
Alias by regular expression.
Please, take a look at the [documentation](http://wiki.rolisteam.org/index.php/en:preferences#) to get more information about aliases.

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/00_alias_en.jpg)

## Share Image

Every one can share picture to all others. This picture appears on everyone screen. Each user may hide it by clicking on title bar. It can be shown again thanks of `Subwindow Menu`. 

The GM or the picture  owner may close it definitivily (menu `file > close` or keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Echap`). 
To share picture, you can do it through menu :  `File > Open > Image` or drag and drop on the main area. 

It is also possible to share image from the internet. 

### Share image from the Internet

It is really easy, just click on `File > Open > Online Image` 

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/07_load_image_from_internet2_en.jpg)

## Maps

Since v1.8, **Rolisteam** provides two kinds of maps: Bipmap or vectorial. 
There are based on two different technologies and concepts. With "bipmap" map, items are painted on map. 
For vectorial map, items are "drop" on the map.

The GM is the only one to create and share map.

### *bipmap* maps

It is possible to add empty map. Empty map has size, permissions and background color.
Alternatively, it is possible to open as background of map. 

##### Empty map

To open an empty map, just click on `file > new > Map` or just press `CTRL+M`. 


![images]({filename}/images/tuto/12_newMap_en.jpg)

**Rolisteam** asks you to define many map properties.

* title
* background color
* size
* permission mode
* Format

There are 3 permission modes: **No permission, Character and All permissions**. 

* "No permission" means only the game master may modify the map.
* "Character" allows players to move their character token. 
* "All permissions gives Game Master rights to all players.

#### Map with image as background

Open image as map background, you just have to click on ```File > Open > Map```

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/16_openMap_en.jpg)

This dialob box allows to select a background image. 
Alternatively, it is also possible to load map (.pla) from your computer. 

Some map properties must/should be defined such title, Permission mode and visibility. 

Check "hidden" if you want your map to appear cover with fog of war. You will reveil the map little by litthe to your players. 


#### Amend map

When the map is opened, you can paint on it. 
To do so, **Rolisteam** provides many painting tools. There are brough together in the map toolbox.

### *vectorial* Map

Vectorial map has been introduced in **Rolisteam** v1.8.  
It's a huge change and it will be too long to describe in details all the possibilities.  
In this tutorial, you may find usual feature descriptions to draw map. It is recommended to train yourself at least once or twice before use this feature in game.  
It may be confusing to discover feature behavior while you are playing.
Another tutorial will be written to details all possibilities about vectorial maps.  
If you need more information about vectorial map, please go to the [documentation](http://wiki.rolisteam.org/index.php/En:vMaps).

#### Add vectorial map

To create an empty vectorial map, please go to the menu `File > new > vectorial map` or directly `CTRL+V`. 

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/13_newVMap_en.jpg)

**Rolisteam** asks values for some vectorial map properties. 

* Title
* Background color
* Permission mode
* Visibility mode
* Grid's shape

When all items are set, just click on `OK` to make appears the vectorial map.
For your information, vectorial map has no size. The size is infinite. 

#### Amend vectorial map

When map has appeared, you can modify it. 
There are two kinds of modifications: visual or access.

#### Interaction on map

On the map, **Rolisteam** provides contextual menu. Through those menu, many actions can be run.
The menu content depends on the current selection.

If you want to know about all features available from contextual menu, please read this [documentation page](http://wiki.rolisteam.org/index.php/En:vMaps#Menu_contextuel_.28clique-droit.29).

## Background music

The GM can broadcast background music. 

![images]({filename}/images/tuto/01_backgroundMusic_en.jpg)

**Rolisteam** has 3 audio players. They are independant. 
Each player has  standard and expected features from audio player.

Control the playing state with ```Play```, ```Pause``` and ```Stop``` buttons.
Audio players accept playing mode: Only one, One by one,  loop.
* Only one mode plays the current song and stop at the end.
* One by one mode plays the current song and then play the following song. It stops when it reaches the playlist's end.
* loop mode plays the current file again and again.

### Add music

The button with ```+``` symbol is gathering all actions about adding file into the playlist.
One click opens file selector dialog. 
One long click shows submenu with additionnal actions: 

* Add song to playlist (defaut)
* Open Playlist
* Load TableTopAudio.com playlist
* Add audio stream

### Remove Music

The ```-``` button means to remove music from the playlist, long click shows the clear function which clear the playlist. 

All of these functions are reachable from the contextual menu.

### Audio files

Due to legal issue, **Rolisteam** does not send audio data. It takes care of synchronizing audio players.
If you can't put your files on the internet or to have an audio stream, you have to send files to your players.
They have to store audio files in their computers.
thanks of some cloud services, sharing and synchronizing directory has become really easy.

Alternatively, **TableTopAudio.com** playlist works like a charm. 

## Minutes Editor

It could be useful to record all events about the game. To do so, **Rolisteam** embeds text editor to take minutes about the game: important NPC, evidences etc.
Notes can be saved as **html**, **pdf** ou **.odt**.

##  Charactersheet

Since v1.8, **Rolisteam** manages charactersheet. **Rolisteam** comes with **RCSE**: "Rolisteam CharacterSheet Editor".
**RCSE** is the best compagnon when editing charactersheet.

### Build your own sheet

To create charactersheet, you have to follow several steps:

1. Drag and drop background image for each page of the character sheet and save your work
2. Draw field at the right position on each page and save your work
3. Generate code and check the result on the "view" tab and save you work
4. make modifications on fields (set label and other properties), return to step 3 until you reach the quality you want, save your work often.
5. On the character tab, add characters and set appropriate value to each field and save you work.
6. Load the result file in **Rolisteam** and share character with its player.

We will written Tutorial about how to make character sheet.

### Using charactersheet into rolisteam

Using charactersheet in **Rolisteam** is simple. The GM loads the character sheet (.rcs). 
Then, Gm must share charactersheet (right-click menu) to player's character. 
A player may have many characters. A character belongs to only one player. Character owns only one charactersheet.

### Where I can find charactersheet  

We bring together all character sheets in one git repository, additionnaly, you can discuss about charactersheet on the forum.

[Charactersheet Git Repository](https://github.com/Rolisteam/rolisteam-character-sheets)
[Topic Forum Officiel](http://forum.rolisteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=61)

## Session and story

Scenario brings together all rolisteam supported media into one file. Maps, vectorial maps, images, charactersheet, playlists and minutes are stored inside the scenario. Other medias will come in the future.

Those documents are listed into the **resources manager**. This panel shows which document is currently part of you scenario. 
The state of each document is stored as well (Open, loaded and unloaded).

It is important to understand the media workflow. The easiest example is an image. When you drag and drop an image into **Rolisteam**.
Everyone sees it.
The image is loaded and open. When you click on the cross on the corner of the window, the image disappears for you only.
In this situation, the image is still loaded.
To show it again, you can go on the subwindow menu.

To close it for everyone, you must go to ```File > Close (CTRL+ESC)```. File state is set to unloaded. however, the file appears into the resources manager as part of the scenario. You can move it into chapter for better lisibility. Or, you can remove it when it is unnecessary to keep it.

## Conclusion

This tutorial is now over. Others will follow. 
I hope it was helpful. I only have to wish you good games with **Rolisteam**.
