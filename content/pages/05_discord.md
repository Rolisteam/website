We developed a Discord bot to offer the power of DiceParser into the discord world. 
It is really easy to use.

## How to install

Just follow this link  
[https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=279722369260453888&scope=bot&permissions=0](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=279722369260453888&scope=bot&permissions=0)  

The link will prompt you to authorize the bot on a server. Once the bot's authorized, you'll see it in the Member List. In a public channel just type any of the commands outlined below and the bot will answer with a dice roll.

##Â Run Command
To run command, you have to send message with ! as first character (just like Rolisteam).  
Example: this is how you can roll two 6-slided dice. 

	:::bash
	!2d6
